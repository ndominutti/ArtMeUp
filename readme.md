# ArtMeUp

### <b>Overview</b>

ArtMeUp is an Style Transfer package, inspired by the content seen in deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization (more specifically in Module 4).<br>
<br>

This package has 2 main objectives:
1) Perform Style Transfer from one image (content image) to another (style image),
2) Create a video with the transition of this transformation. To archieve this aim we are going to use a vgg19 model.

<br>
When runing the code, you can decide to stop after objective one (eg. save your images) or keep working to fulfill objective 2.

### <b>Repo usage</b>

To use this repo you should:
> 1) Clone it to your machine
> 2) Depending in the objective pursued you should instanciate class Artist, ImgsToVideo or both (take a glance inside example.ipynb to see an usage example)

* If you want to read a slightly more explained article from this project take a look at this Medium post: 

* If you don't own a GPU in your local machine, it's highly recommended to run the code in a Google Colab environment (using the GPU), to take a look at an example get into this link:
